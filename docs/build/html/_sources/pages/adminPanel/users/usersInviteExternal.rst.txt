Behaviour of invite external user
=================================

After invitation creation the user who has not registered yet will get the email with the link to the registration form.
If user follows this link he/she will be redirected to the registration form with prefilled email address and name (if name set up at the invitation form), where email is not editable.
As soon as user fill required field at the registration page and confirm registration he will create user profile, account and mailbox(es) and also get permissions according to the permissions which has been set at the invitation step.
