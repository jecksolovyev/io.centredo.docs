How to create user or users within verified domain you can find in the topic :ref:`how to create user/users <create-users>` .

How users will be assigned to account within verified domain?
=============================================================

As soon as you've added, verified and activated domain you can create and manage users with respective domains.

* Users who have been registered before domains verification and activation will be automatically assigned to account which verified domain. These users will not lose any permissions to account/mailboxes they have already have.

* Users who register after domains verification and activation will be automatically assigned to account which verified domain. These users will not have any access to any account/mailbox until administrator of the account add respective permissions.

What will happen to users if domain will be unverified or account will be deleted?
==================================================================================
